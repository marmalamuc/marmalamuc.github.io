    <p>The world’s response to the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been surprisingly heartening. I don’t think I can say anything useful about what’s happening there, but it does make me wonder about the future of warfare.<!-- here --> Can we now expect countries to recruit support on social media? I mean beyond misinformation &amp; propaganda spread by bots, which of course has been a strategy used effectively by dictator-like politicians (Putin, American Republicans) for several years now.</p>

<p>Zelensky seems to be running one of the most brilliant marketing campaigns in the history of the discipline. He’s not physically fighting, right? But his photos &amp; speeches are posturing in that way, and the entire world has responded. I don’t mean that critically at all—he’s leading in what seems to be the most effective possible way for his citizens. It just makes think that [] might be the new normal.</p>

<h2 id="the-booksite">The booksite</h2>
<p>Aside from some small clean-up efforts, the only real news to share is that I’ve been in touch with a couple professionals in book publishing industry: <a href="https://www.pdx.edu/profile/kathi-inman-berens">Dr. Kathi Inman Berens</a> &amp; <a href="https://emilyhkeough.wordpress.com">Emily HagenBurger Keough</a>.</p>

<h3 id="promotion--publicity">Promotion &amp; publicity</h3>
<p>a</p>

<h2 id="submissions">Submissions</h2>
<p>My last forthcoming publication (<a href="https://www.poetrysalzburg.com/psr-no38.htm">Poetry Salzburg Review</a>) is now out in print.</p>

<p>No regular journal submissions recently; though, I have been applying &amp; submitting for other opportunities:</p>

<h3 id="fellowships">Fellowships</h3>
<p>a</p>
<ul>
  <li>NEA</li>
  <li>Just Buffalo Literary Center</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="chapbooks">Chapbooks</h3>
<p>I put together a chapbook-length collection on the theme of masculinity, and began submitting:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Button</li>
  <li>Rattle</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.sundresspublications.com/safta">SAFTA</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Even though I’m releasing the booksite as a full manuscript later this year, I thought having my name to something with an established publisher would augment my promotion efforts for <em>The Great Permission</em>.</p>

<h2 id="personal-stuff">Personal stuff</h2>
<p>My parents made the decision to put down their dog last month. He was about 17, and his body had been falling apart. I did get to say goodbye to him when I helped my parents move back to Buffalo in mid-February. It was painful to watch him struggle to walk; his hips seemed to be detached from their sockets. I had to carry him down the few steps to the backyard so he could pee &amp; poop. He had lost his senses of smell &amp; hearing long ago, and I think he was mostly blind by the end. His body was covered with (benign) tumors, and his teeth were rotting (the dentist had said years ago that he was already too old to be put under).</p>

<p>Still, I’m grateful I was able to see him one last time. It’s rare to have that opportunity.
