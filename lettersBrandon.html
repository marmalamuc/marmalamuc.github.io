        <h2>Dead Letters (to Brandon)</h2>



<div class="headRoom">  <p>Brandon, I looked around today and didn't recognize the city.<br />
	It feels <i>flat</i>, tastes like the flood rinsed<br />
  our salt into a gulch. Do you know what I mean?<br />
  The branches are gone. The river has crossed itself.<br />
  It's like where once there were bridges,<br />
  now there are tolls.</p>

  <p>Remember Nashville before Opry Mills?<br />
  440 I think was drivable.<br />
  Good country boys didn't visit Printer's Alley.<br />
  Or didn't mention it in polite company.<br />
  Does it feel like we skipped something?<br />
  Some years? Missed a war?<br />
  A coronation? Maybe it's the fatigue<br />
  of my seasonal allergies.<br />
  Maybe it's that your son is already three&mdash;<br />
  born into an exhausting era&mdash;<br />
  and we all take fewer naps than we'd like.</p>

  <p>Your favorite story about me, I think, is from college.<br />
  The space on my dresser from which&mdash;one day<br />
  in early spring&mdash;I was convinced<br />
  something had been taken. I searched for months.<br />
  Yelled, swore, unpacked, repacked,<br />
  &amp; unpacked again the dresser, closet.<br />
  Sixteen years later, I still have no idea<br />
  what it was. The smallest things<br />
  have always unraveled my knots: jagged nail<br />
  snagging my necktie, clock that won't hang<br />
  symmetrically, one shoe tighter<br />
  than the other. You didn't know <br />
  how to tie your shoes when we met.<br />
  <q>The fuck are you doing?</q>, I asked<br />
  staring at your mess of bights, turned<br />
  &amp; turned, elbows bent to breaking.<br />
  Did I show you, then, the delicate work<br />
  of dressing the knot&mdash;a simple square<br />
  finished with a slip?</p>

  <p>Back then I hated coffee. Any 19 year old but you<br />
  I'd think enjoyed more the image of coffee&mdash;<br />
  the paraphernalia of adulthood. Even then,<br />
  when we were children, your body looked lived in,<br />
  always fit through the shoulders &amp; hips.<br />
  Unlike most of us, who squirm our way to 30,<br />
  wringing our collars, cuffing our pants,<br />
  tucking &amp; untucking our shirttails.<br />
  To witness someone wear his skin<br />
  as though natural as opening a door&mdash;<br />
  I followed your lead, faked<br />
  that ease, practicing the amble &amp; babble<br />
  I'd later need to perform. And so you pushed<br />
  &amp; pulled me into a shape<br />
  that let my body move calmly in this world.</p>

  <p>Brandon, this is it. When they ask in 30 years<br />
  <q>What were you like when you were young?</q><br />
  &mdash;they mean now. They mean<br />
  did you wear clothes that look silly today,<br />
  where did you travel, drink,<br />
  were you ever in a fight.<br />
  Nothing important.</p>

  <p>This is our life happening. The shape of it<br />
  we never would have guessed. The pain we confronted,<br />
  invited. The women who freed themselves<br />
  before loving us. Not for us.<br />
  But in a way that would allow them to embrace us.<br />
  Though they don't want to be held,<br />
  hold us, as much as we'd like.<br />
  It's okay. It's enough<br />
  that they sometimes, just as we're dozing off,<br />
  turn away, scoot their butts<br />
  against us so we know it's fine to roll over,<br />
  cast our limbs against their form,<br />
  nibble their shoulders&mdash;<br />
  even if it's only to steal our body heat.</p>

  <p>Brandon, I feel lost here. Hiding away<br />
  at home except those rare times<br />
  we share a meal. I have not been with the world.<br />
  In this city where, it feels, I have always<br />
  been caught in the river's current. Stevie said <q>in it<br />
  but not of it</q>. The Boss said he &amp; Terry hid<br />
  on the backstreets, and I think he meant<br />
  <i>delaying a choice</i>, living their way<br />
  into a devotion neither was ready to understand&mdash;<br />
  two boys, trying on their masculinity<br />
  like a wardrobe of silk. I'm not sure<br />
  if Terry's a man. I've always wanted Terry to be a man,<br />
  the song an ode to love without sex, without shame&mdash;<br />
  the difficult love of honesty.<br />
  An intimacy the genitals are never awake for.<br />
  The groove shifts to the backbeat<br />
  searching for maybe the right cadence<br />
  to mimic the safety of holding to your chest<br />
  the man whose friendship both opened<br />
  a room of permission<br />
  and covered its mirrors.
  <!-- &mdash;a room in which he spliced<br />
  the strands of separate (expression)<br />
  to (loosen/lighten) our {weight a rope bears},<br />
  (assemble/lash) []--></p>

  <p>All of which is to say&mdash;<br />
  just this morning I noticed the half-dead tree<br />
  in my backyard was fruiting.<br />
  The dead half swayed gently,<br />
  sure to crack &amp; fall within a season.<br />
  The living half had scattered<br />
  mulberries that, at one time,<br />
  years ago, before my blood clot &amp; your son<br />
  &amp; the anvil of our love,<br /><!-- an anvil is part of a multicut toolâ€”the surface the blade contacts after cutting through something -->
  I might have considered a mess.</p>

  <p>Hear now my steady breath&mdash;<br />
  in through my nostrils, fills my belly,<br />
  chest, shoulders, out through my mouth.<br />
  See the mud on my knees &amp; elbows, lips,<br />
  the seeds in my teeth, my hands<br />
  black &amp; sticky, shining<br />
  with a pleasure<br />
  I had to live my way into.</p>
