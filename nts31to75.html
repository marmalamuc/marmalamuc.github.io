<meta name="description" content="Maybe by now, no one has to speak. If Neuralink developed the tech, your mind is connected to all other minds &amp; machines, and just a thought can unlock the door blocking your understanding from her experience. Do you still write poems? What even is a poem when joy is the idea of joy and not the best iteration of a series of failures? What do we call art when there are no filters on the complexity of any psyche? Possibly, there’s no more makeup sex. Or breakup sex. Since miscommunication doesn’t exist. omg what is sex like? Are we all immediately honest about that thing I really want you to do to me, but am too embarrassed to say out loud? How do we apply our bodies to this world? Who opted to live &amp; die by the anchor of the mouth? Who did we price out of (the path of least resistance)? Did they congregate in Utah? What trouble isn’t solved when the concept of dishonesty is a man who won’t share his awareness? I can tell Andrew’s hiding something, because the picture isn’t clear. I’m trying to imagine the shape of our institutions: governments, markets, schools. Do we still have politicians when every citizen (can be polled)? Can you buy stock with a thought? Ally against oligarchs churning liquid for the whales? Did we stop cringing at the complexity of simple percentages because those elegant proofs ceased to be a translation, became for all a knowing? Seriously, does anyone write poems? What need for writers when the connections are bare, our consciousness fully shared? What witness must be borne? How quaint it must seem to compress the body&#39;s bruises into language, to insist upon the sensory, to make of your life an immense loneliness, an archive of your ignorance." />
