&lt;h2 id=&quot;publications&quot;&gt;Publications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&quot;https://poetryinthebrew.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;Poetry in the Brew&lt;/a&gt; anthology &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://aprilgloaming.com/shop/sinew-10-years-of-poetry-in-the-brew-2011-2021/&quot;&gt;Sinew&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt; was released on August 24, and I attended their in-person release party last night at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.portlandbrewcoffee.net/&quot;&gt;Portland Brew East&lt;/a&gt;, PitB’s home since 2011. You can catch me on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.facebook.com/poetryinthebrew/videos/152083610409589&quot;&gt;Facebook Live feed&lt;/a&gt;, starting at 56:20. I’m so out of practice that when I fucked up my second poem, I didn’t have the presence of mind to start over. Not to mention all the fidgeting &lt;em class=&quot;far fa-meh fa-1x&quot;&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also received another acceptance since I last updated—&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ws.edu/special-events/mildred-haun/review/&quot;&gt;The Mildred Haun Review&lt;/a&gt;, out of Walter State Community College, which should be released some time this Fall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t submitted anything since ::checks notes:: the first week of May, so I’m not expecting any more acceptances until I get back to it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-book&quot;&gt;The book&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have made no progress on the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I still have to solve my issues with &lt;a href=&quot;/moreBeautifulThings#thebook&quot;&gt;creating the Gallery&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;/blogsongs#thebook&quot;&gt;the previous/next buttons&lt;/a&gt;, but just care less &amp;amp; less about it the longer the pandemic drags on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;life-in-general&quot;&gt;Life in general&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The personal circumstances of my life are fine. I can’t see the people I love as much as I want, and my corporate job is a corporate job, but otherwise, I have no problems that it feels fair to complain about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I tend to cycle through depressive or anxious periods, often in the summer, and this year has continued that pattern. The news of the world, and especially my home in the United States, is usually the trigger:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;climate disasters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Republicans being absolute worthless trash&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the idiocy of COVID/vaccine/mask deniers, and the lives destroyed by their selfishness&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the havoc my country’s imperialism continues to cause around the world&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;the fundamental inequality within my country&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the things that send me into a spiral of depression were problems with my life, at least I could work on them. But I’m mostly powerless to fix the problems of the environment in which I live. I can exercise, eat well, meditate, practice gratitude all fucking day, but none of that will end the imminently endable pandemic here in the United States.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrew P.

He’s been following this website, and reading the poems I point to from the &lt;a href=&quot;/links&quot;&gt;Links page&lt;/a&gt;. Ryan recently “confessed” (his word) that, although he has a degree in English/Creative Writing, and has written &amp;amp; even taught some poetry, he doesn’t really understand it. &lt;!-- here --&gt;I told him I would probably turn our emails into a blog post, so here’s an edited version of my reply.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But first, some small updates. Skip to the &lt;a href=&quot;#poetry-in-america-scratching-the-surface&quot;&gt;Poetry section&lt;/a&gt; if you’re not interested in new pubs or site updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;publications&quot;&gt;Publications&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Several of my poems that had been accepted were published in March or April:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two poems in &lt;a href=&quot;https://pleaseseeme.com/issue-7/poetry/two-poems-andrew-p-dillon/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Please See Me&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One poem in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.secondchancelit.com/dillon&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Second Chance Lit&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two poems in &lt;a href=&quot;https://bosphorusreview.com/march2021&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Bosphorus Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wrote the poems in &lt;em&gt;Please See Me&lt;/em&gt; in the months &amp;amp; years after my blood clot (maybe a post about that one day). They deal with some specific mental health struggles &amp;amp; recoveries (&lt;em class=&quot;fas fa-exclamation-circle&quot;&gt;&lt;/em&gt; TW: suicidal ideation)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also got word of two more acceptances:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two poems in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.poetrysalzburg.com/psr-main.htm&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Poetry Salzburg Review&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Iss. 38, Winter 2021)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;One poem in &lt;a href=&quot;https://aprilgloaming.com/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sinew: 10 Years of Poetry in the Brew, 2011–2021&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Summer 2021)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the poems to be published in &lt;em&gt;Poetry Salzburg Review&lt;/em&gt; is 13 years old! It’s among the first poems I wrote after taking up writing in college, in an undergrad workshop led by &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.arthursmithpoet.com/&quot;&gt;Art Smith&lt;/a&gt;. So the lesson I’m going to take is: stick with the poems you believe in, even when years of rejection can get you thinking that a poem is no good.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-formatting-features&quot;&gt;New formatting features&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a tech writer, I read a handful of industry blogs to stay on top of things. &lt;a href=&quot;https://gmbaker.net/&quot;&gt;Mark Baker’s&lt;/a&gt; is one of those blogs. He recently wrote something about readers being interested in process, and blogs being well suited to elucidating a journey (I can’t find the specific quote right now). With that in mind, I continue to post about my tweaks to the source code of this website:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I copied a couple features from Tom Johnson’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/index.html&quot;&gt;Jekyll Theme for Doc&lt;/a&gt; to use here. Just some new things to break up the monotony of black text on a white background. I’ll try not to overuse them &lt;em class=&quot;far fa-grimace fa-1x&quot;&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;callouts&quot;&gt;Callouts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I copy &amp;amp; pasted into my stylesheet the Bootstrap styles that format some simple panels that a tech writer would use for notes, warnings, alerts. Then I grabbed his include and put it in my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_includes&lt;/code&gt; directory. Remember that in gem-based versions of Jekyll, the directories &amp;amp; files that build the structure of your site live in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gem&lt;/code&gt; folder on your local drive. With at least Minima, the default Jekyll theme I use here, those include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;table&gt;
  &lt;colgroup&gt;
    &lt;col width=&quot;15%&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;col width=&quot;85%&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;/colgroup&gt;
  &lt;thead&gt;
    &lt;tr class=&quot;header&quot;&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Directory&lt;/th&gt;
      &lt;th&gt;Example files&lt;/th&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/thead&gt;
  &lt;tbody&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_includes&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Files that are probably injected into every page:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;header.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;head.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;footer.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;google-analytics.html&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
    &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_layouts&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;Files that define the structure of individual pages. I have separate layouts for my:
        &lt;ul&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;homepage&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;posts&lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;pages that are neither of the other two&lt;/li&gt;
        &lt;/ul&gt;
        There's also a &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; layout that calls the head, header, &amp;amp; footer files. All the above layouts specify &lt;code&gt;layout: default&lt;/code&gt; in their frontmatter so the head, header, &amp;amp; footer get pulled in to every page.
      &lt;/td&gt;
    &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;tr&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_sass&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
        &lt;td&gt;Files for the CSS preprocessor, Sass, which allows you to single-source your styles&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt;
  &lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also add any of those directories to your project tree (where everything you write, like posts &amp;amp; images, lives). I have an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_includes&lt;/code&gt; directory in my project folder for a few things like the callouts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;callout.html&lt;/code&gt; file looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;div&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;markdown=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;span&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;bs-callout bs-callout-{{include.type}}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;{{include.content}}&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I want to use a callout on a page, I write a line of Liquid that grabs everything in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;callout.html&lt;/code&gt;. It looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-liquid highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;callout.html&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;default&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;content&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;This is where I type what I want to appear in the callout.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can even speed that up using snippets. Atom (my preferred editor) uses CoffeeScript, a JSON-like syntax, to specify a prefix that expands into a larger block of code. I type &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;callout&lt;/code&gt;, and the whole include above appears.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The include is rendered like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;bs-callout bs-callout-default&quot;&gt;
This is where I type what I want to appear in the callout.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;!-- callout types:
  danger
  default
  primary
  success
  info
  warning
--&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fontawesome-icons&quot;&gt;Fontawesome icons&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Jekyll Doc Theme also incorporates icons from &lt;a href=&quot;https://fontawesome.com&quot;&gt;Fontawesome&lt;/a&gt; (among others). It was easy to inject them with a line of Javascript in my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;head.html&lt;/code&gt; file (an include) that connects to a Content Delivery Network to call the icons.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, I use the semantically meaningless &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; element to specify which icon I want by adding specific classes to it: &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;i class=&quot;fas fa-icon-name fa-icon-size&quot;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;. I wrote an include to do that too:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;class=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{{include.prefix}} fa-{{include.name}} fa-{{include.size}}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/i&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;prefix&lt;/strong&gt; tells it whether to be bold, regular, or a brand logo. I search their library to find the &lt;strong&gt;name&lt;/strong&gt;. The icons inherit your styles, so the &lt;strong&gt;size&lt;/strong&gt; tells it whether to fit into your line height (1x), or be larger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-liquid highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{%&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;include&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;icon.html&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;prefix&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;fas&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;book-open&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;1x&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;w&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;%}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That include produces the book icon that now appears in the text at the bottom of every post that explains the shitty pun in my title:
&lt;em class=&quot;fas fa-book-open fa-1x&quot;&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s in every post because I put that code into my &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post.html&lt;/code&gt; layout file. Meaning, whenever a file contains &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;layout: post&lt;/code&gt; in the YAML frontmatter, everything in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;post.html&lt;/code&gt; gets added (or not, depending on the &lt;strong&gt;if&lt;/strong&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;strong&gt;for&lt;/strong&gt; logic in the file).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;poetry-in-america-scratching-the-surface&quot;&gt;Poetry in America: scratching the surface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are always people claiming that poetry (or art in general) is dying. When I was getting my MFA, a handful of essays were published on the decline of American verse that became hot topics in the discourse community of poets. The two I remember most are Mark Edmundson’s &lt;cite class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;Poetry Slam&lt;/cite&gt; in &lt;cite class=&quot;journal&quot;&gt;Harper’s Magazine&lt;/cite&gt; (July 2013), and Arthur Krystal’s &lt;cite class=&quot;article&quot;&gt;The Missing Music in Today’s Poetry&lt;/cite&gt; in &lt;cite class=&quot;journal&quot;&gt;The Chronicle of Higher Education&lt;/cite&gt; (October 2013).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These arguments almost always rely on equivocation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start with an abstraction that’s never defined (i.e., “music in poetry”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Make a claim about a different, also undefined, concept (“meter”)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the two concepts interchangeably&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Wrap up the article, ignoring (or unaware of) your fallacy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, as always, there was no crisis in poetry. It’s just different from what those authors prefer. But I do think we have some kind of problem with how poetry is broadly perceived. In this post, I want to think through a couple ways that poetry exists in America.&lt;/p&gt;

For this post, just assume I’m talking about poetics &amp;amp; pedagogy in the American context. I’m not sure how poetry is introduced in other countries, or how it functions in other cultures.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think there are two big, related issues at the root of folks believing poetry is hard to understand. But no one should feel bad about believing that. I don’t think we set students up to appreciate poetry. Here’s how I’ll approach that below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#the-problem-of-pedagogy&quot;&gt;The way poetry is introduced to students makes it hard to appreciate&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#the-problem-of-culture&quot;&gt;Poetry doesn’t have a much of a role in American culture anymore&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#practical-matters&quot;&gt;Some simple analysis &amp;amp; advice&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations for poems that (I think) anyone will appreciate, regardless of how much poetry they read&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem-of-pedagogy&quot;&gt;The problem of pedagogy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The poems I remember being introduced to in middle &amp;amp; high school were Shakespeare’s sonnets, and later some Dickinson &amp;amp; Frost. In schools, Shakespeare is still the standard-bearer for poetry &amp;amp; drama in the English language. To me, that’s insane, and a huge disservice to poetry, poets, &amp;amp; students. Why would an &lt;em&gt;introduction&lt;/em&gt; to poetry contain Shakespeare or Dickinson? (Frost seems to have fallen out of favor in academia compared to other Modernists.) Dickinson was a radical innovator of language, form, &amp;amp; punctuation. Shakespeare’s language is archaic—you need a translator to understand Victorian English. Take &lt;em&gt;Romeo &amp;amp; Juliet&lt;/em&gt;’s famous balcony soliloquy:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?&lt;br /&gt;
Deny thy father and refuse thy name.&lt;br /&gt;
Or if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love&lt;br /&gt;
And I’ll no longer be a Capulet.&lt;br /&gt;
‘Tis but thy name that is my enemy:&lt;br /&gt;
Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.&lt;br /&gt;
What’s Montague? It is nor hand nor foot&lt;br /&gt;
Nor arm nor face nor any other part&lt;br /&gt;
Belonging to a man. O be some other name.&lt;br /&gt;
What’s in a name? That which we call a rose&lt;br /&gt;
By any other name would smell as sweet;&lt;br /&gt;
So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call’d,&lt;br /&gt;
Retain that dear perfection which he owes&lt;br /&gt;
Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,&lt;br /&gt;
And for that name, which is no part of thee,&lt;br /&gt;
Take all myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—and consider the difference in meaning depending on whether you understand the first line to mean “Where are you, Romeo?” vs. “Why are you Romeo?”. “Wherefore”, of course, meant “why” in Victorian English, so the first line is asking “Why must you be a Montague (and I a Capulet)?”. You need a teacher or a book with glosses to explain that to you. Meanwhile, there are thousands of living poets writing in idioms any kid can grasp. You do not need a primer to understand the poetry of your own era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- Shakespeare meme --&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;docimage&quot; src=&quot;images/billyShakesMeme.png&quot; alt=&quot;A meme image of Shakespeare that says 'Is the central focus of high school English | Basically write in a different language'&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 300px&quot; /&gt;   &lt;figcaption style=&quot;max-width: 300px&quot;&gt;
Let's teach 500 year old literature to every student as though we haven't been telling the same 27 stories since humans could speak
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the language, the cultural touchstones in the work of Shakespeare &amp;amp; Dickinson are irrelevant to any 21st century teenager. Again, you need so much contextual knowledge to appreciate what’s going on. Matthew Zapruder did an interview a few years ago on the podcast &lt;a href=&quot;http://historyofliterature.com/138-why-poetry-with-matthew-zapruder/&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The History of Literature&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. In it, he talks about some problems with how poetry is taught, and one of them is this idea that you must learn the context of a poem before you can read it; and related, the belief that poetic language is coded and must carry some significant, deeper message.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reader, if you are here and happen to not be a writer, please tell yourself that there is no key to understanding poetry. Repeat that to yourself every day, make it your meditation anchor. Just get it out of your head that poetry is a cipher. And of course, read some poetry by writers who are alive &amp;amp; writing now. (See my &lt;a href=&quot;#recommendations&quot;&gt;recommendations&lt;/a&gt; below.) If it seems like poems are hiding something, it’s probably because &lt;em&gt;it’s hard to say what you feel&lt;/em&gt;—the stuff going on in our heads is not organized into language—and poets usually solve for that by talking about something else (most commonly with metaphor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another pedagogical issue for new readers is that teachers may fall back on the “rules” of poetry to fill out lesson plans. The prescriptive rules of poetry are not important; we don’t write in fixed meters or rhyme schemes anymore. Or when we do, it’s usually an exercise. In any case, a new reader doesn’t need to know anything about stress patterns, types of rhyme, or even rhetorical structures to appreciate a poem. There’s no reason for a teacher who’s introducing students to poetry to mention those things—let alone teach scansion. Why would any kid need to know that a sonnet is 14 lines of iambic pentameter (in English)? Unless you’re taking a class in &lt;strong&gt;writing&lt;/strong&gt; poetry, I don’t think you ever need to talk about that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given an introduction of cryptic language by dead white people and rote memorization, I can see why most kids never engage with the form after high school.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-problem-of-culture&quot;&gt;The problem of culture&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The idea that it’s difficult to “understand” poetry is a significant problem for poets. It’s not a critical problem—people still write poetry &amp;amp; study it &amp;amp; turn to it in times of need; and there are some truly mammoth poets writing right now, in English, living in America. But poets used to be on magazine covers; newspapers used to publish poetry daily or weekly. It was part of our cultural conversation. Now, you might hear some poetry at a wedding (usually Biblical stuff) or at the Presidential inauguration. I’m not sure what happened between then &amp;amp; now. It probably requires a qualitative study, but I suspect that it involves a few factors:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul class=&quot;fa-ul&quot;&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fa-li&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;fas fa-spinner fa-pulse&quot;&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poetry demands time &amp;amp; attention&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; You can't casually read a poem like you can watch a sitcom or read an article on Buzzfeed. There's rarely immediate gratification with a poem.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fa-li&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;fas fa-spinner fa-pulse&quot;&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Poetry deals with complex, difficult material, and often doesn't resolve in satisfying ways&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Americans hate being uncomfortable and dealing with ambiguity. To be fair, that's probably true of most people. And often, poetry doesn't resolve in &lt;em&gt;any&lt;/em&gt; kind of way.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;fa-li&quot;&gt;&lt;em class=&quot;fas fa-spinner fa-pulse&quot;&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;strong&gt;There's no quantitative argument for poetry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Even young, liberal-minded Americans struggle with how productive they are or aren't. You don't earn anything objectively valuable on your investment in the time it takes to read or write a poem. And even if you did, vanishingly few people can be professional poets (without the support &amp;amp; extra work of Academia).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And now these problems kinda perpetuate themselves. One of my all-time favorite poems is Jack Gilbert’s &lt;cite class=&quot;poem&quot;&gt;The Forgotten Dialect of the Heart&lt;/cite&gt;; in it, these lines (underline emphasis mine):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We say &lt;span class=&quot;noStyle&quot;&gt;bread&lt;/span&gt; and it means according&lt;br /&gt;
to which nation. French has no word for home,&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;u&gt;and we have no word for strict pleasure.&lt;/u&gt; A people&lt;br /&gt;
in Northern India is dying out because their ancient&lt;br /&gt;
tongue has no words for endearment. […]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2015/12/the-book-of-human-emotions-language-feelings/420978/&quot;&gt;evidence to suggest&lt;/a&gt; that if we don’t have a word for something, we don’t fully experience it. I think constantly about Gilbert’s line, and how Americans are really bad at relaxing because (yes, Puritanism, but also) we don’t have words to describe things we do (or don’t do) &lt;em&gt;only because they feel good&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Leisure&lt;/em&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;em&gt;recreation&lt;/em&gt; approach it, but even our hobbies &amp;amp; passions become commoditized, and we end up wrapping all of that in the language of the marketplace:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I’m &lt;em&gt;spending my time&lt;/em&gt; writing this weekend&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I didn’t have a very &lt;em&gt;productive&lt;/em&gt; writing session last night&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I should &lt;em&gt;invest some time&lt;/em&gt; in finding an open mic&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It’s hard to &lt;em&gt;produce good work&lt;/em&gt; during the pandemic&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So we drink &amp;amp; shop instead. Not everything needs to be a hustle. Gardening might be the last refuge of American pure leisure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- image: Stop confusing relaxation with laziness --&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;docimage&quot; src=&quot;images/strictPleasure.png&quot; alt=&quot;A picture of one corner of the author's living room.

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;practical-matters&quot;&gt;Practical matters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think what most poets would tell you is the reader shouldn’t be worried about understanding the poem, because they only wrote the poem to help them understand something. So one good way to think about poetry is as a method of understanding—for the writer. But there’s no 100% poem, no poem that knows exactly what it’s talking about. Or, if there is, it’s probably a boring poem. (I’m &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.commonpodcast.com/home/2017/1/20/episode-18-terrance-hayes&quot;&gt;paraphrasing Terrance Hayes&lt;/a&gt; here.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you read, you’re bringing a whole lifetime of experiences to the poem; so in a way, the poem can’t be complete until you read &amp;amp; receive some kind of message. Even if what you thought wasn’t what the writer had in mind, most of them would say you aren’t wrong. Because they’re still not sure about it either!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, there is a lot of esoteric poetry written by people who don’t really care if their poems make any kind of sense. And schools of poetry that I still can’t get my head around. The “Language Poets” are a good example of the latter. I have a master’s in the art, and still have no idea what they’re doing. Maybe it’s because, as a School of Poetics, they have an ethos, and I’m quick to reject the formalization of art.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But okay, here’s some practical advice about reading poems:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;strong&gt;Read every poem out loud&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br /&gt; Or listen to the audio if available. Poetry's an oral art, meant to be heard, and there's a lot to receive in the cadence &amp;amp; stresses of a poem. There's also something visceral about the poem in your mouth. I know that sounds silly. Nevertheless.
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It must be said: there are a lot of poets with some unfortunate reading habits; they chant or sound bored or don’t let their poems breathe. Poet Voice. You probably know it when you hear it. Mostly though, the poet is the best reader of their own work. Like hearing a songwriter perform the song they wrote vs. the artist who cut it. There’s some kind of magic there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recommendations&quot;&gt;Recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To grease the wheel a bit, here are a handful of poems I think are easy to appreciate. Poems that swing for the heart, so to speak:&lt;/p&gt;

I wrote what you see below, and have been sitting on it for a month, thinking I’d come to some moment of clarity or at least understanding. I did not.&lt;!-- here --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;melissa-rosella-marion&quot;&gt;Melissa Rosella Marion&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I met Melissa in middle school. I think we first connected over being northerners in Nashville (she being from Perth, Ontario, and me being from Buffalo). We graduated in the same high school class, ended up at different colleges in Tennessee, but stayed in loose touch through social media.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When she was traveling in her early 20s (and I was dreaming about it), she would send me postcards. I saved them, but after a dozen moves, I’m not sure anymore what container they’re stored in. At the time (say, mid 20-aughts), she said Ireland was the most beautiful place she had ever seen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On one Facebook comment in which I was screaming into the void about our broken, imperialist country, she commented that this kind of conviction was one reason she had a crush on me in middle school. I think I laughed because this seemed like the kind of thing she would never have said in person.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We used to read &amp;amp; comment on each others blogs: Livejournal, Xanga, Myspace. On these platforms &amp;amp; others, she often used the handle &lt;em&gt;Girl of the North Country&lt;/em&gt; after the Dylan song of the same name. She was the first person to tell me I had talent as a writer; and so she was the first person I thought of to acknowledge in my book. I took it for granted that I’d get to tell her when I finished.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melissa died on February 20th. She was 35, same as me (we were born in the same month, in fact). To my knowledge, the cause of death is still unknown. She was married, and many of her friends are people I also grew up with. She was an accomplished &amp;amp; award-winning photographer (see her &lt;a href=&quot;site.data.keys.links.melissaInsta&quot;&gt;Instagram&lt;/a&gt;). She was also in the process of writing three different novels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I imagine she had no idea that her belief in my writing had an impact on me—why would she? It was the simple generosity of attention. At the time, even I had no real practice or plans to “be” a writer. I’ve probably weighed it too heavily in my memory, but her support made me feel like it was worth pursuing—that if I wrote, people who had no connection or obligation to me might read &amp;amp; connect with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s simple to say that we were friends. Truthfully, we didn’t really stay in touch, and only once met up in person after high school (I was working in Baltimore for a summer, where she lived at the time). We had a particular connection during a particular time in our lives. We don’t have a word for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to articulate the grief I’m feeling, mostly because, as I said, we weren’t close in any conventional way. She just felt like an important person to me. I don’t know her husband or other family; her best friend was also a high school classmate. I know I cannot comprehend the magnitude of their pain right now, but still feel like I have to express the despair I’m experiencing right now. I never got to tell this woman that her presence mattered, and I don’t understand why that’s impossible now. I feel anger at my inability to understand, and overwhelmed with regret for not maintaining this relationship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I know I’m rambling. Trying to make sense of death. All our myths &amp;amp; archetypes, but I don’t know anyone who has said anything comforting or illuminating without reducing it to some paternalistic fairy tale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started a poem in her memory that I plan to include in the book, assuming it comes together in a way that feels complete &amp;amp; respectful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Melissa, I miss you. To whatever extent I can be considered successful as a writer, you deserve some of the credit. Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrew P.

My gym was hit by the tornado that flattened a path through East Nashville; and of course, the pandemic was fully in effect just a couple weeks later. There are several regulars in the early afternoon, and on Monday this week, a woman stopped to say hello.&lt;!-- here --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She said she had dreamed about me before she started seeing me at the track. In her dream, I was an advocate for others and in the act of standing up for a person or group of people who couldn’t represent themselves; and because she hadn’t known my name, she was calling me Jonathan Roberts (or was it Rogers? The way she said it made it seem like that name was relevant to advocacy. I looked it up but didn’t find anything).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was very flattering, but I didn’t know how to respond. I often struggle with the idea that I’m not doing enough to help others. I donate money, but shouldn’t I donate my time and more of my voice? I’m not caught up with being a “good” or likable person, but I do try to identify how I can be a more moral &amp;amp; ethical person. For a moment I felt like this stranger’s avatar of me was more virtuous that the real me was capable of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think she must be an artist. I hope I’ll get a chance to chat with her again soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-book&quot;&gt;The book&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I haven’t made any real progress on the book lately, but I’m taking some PTO next month to focus on finishing a handful of poems and working through a couple coding issues with the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did have a brief exchange with &lt;a href=&quot;https://keithswilson.com&quot;&gt;Keith Wilson&lt;/a&gt; on Twitter about digital interactive poetry. He’s doing some interesting things with an open-source platform called &lt;a href=&quot;https://twinery.org&quot;&gt;Twine&lt;/a&gt;, which I’d never heard of, but looks like it’s been around for several years. Check out his poem that was published in &lt;a href=&quot;http://keithswilson.com/Blueshift%20Journal%20Love%20-%20Backup/The%20Blueshift%20Journal%20_%20keith%20wilson.html&quot;&gt;The Blueshift Journal&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can see how the reader exerts a sort of control over the poem; each reading is a potentially new experience, giving rise to different interpretations even from the same reader. I think Keith’s work here is beyond the interactivity I’m creating with my webbook, and opens up some really fascinating artistic avenues. I need to learn Javascript anyway, so when I have some available mental space, Twine might be a good baby step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;new-publications-forthcoming&quot;&gt;New publications forthcoming&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After sending submissions to forty journals since the beginning of October, two acceptances came back within a couple days. Both should be out this Spring:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;second-chance-lit&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.secondchancelit.com&quot;&gt;Second Chance Lit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A journal for poems that have been rejected at least once. They took a poem called “The Author at 11 Wanted to be Reincarnated as a Dog” that I wanted to say I wrote &amp;amp; finished last year, but now that I’m checking I see that I actually started drafting three years ago. That’s a pretty average turnaround time for the bulk of my poems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;please-see-me&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pleaseseeme.com&quot;&gt;Please See Me&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dedicated to healthcare narratives. They took two poems I started drafting during the recovery after my blood clot in 2015: “Blood Clot: Coda” &amp;amp; “From the Shadow (5)”. They ask poets to send in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.mp3&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.wav&lt;/code&gt; recordings of them reading their work, which I love. I’ve been recording scratch files of my poems for the book, so I’m all set up. Also, they’re a paying market!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;serialized-poems&quot;&gt;Serialized poems&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the poems Please See Me took is part of a series about my shadow—the element of the subconscious that Carl Jung called “the reservoir for human darkness [and] the seat of creativity” (and Robert Bly described as “the long bag we drag behind us”). I have several other series that I write in at no particular pace. Each series centers around a loose ethos; the Shadow poems are about the pieces of myself that I’m afraid of and have largely buried. They also often reveal indiscretions against others. In the case of the poem that will be published, it’s about me &amp;amp; my sometimes unhealthy relationship with my body.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my MFA workshops, &lt;a href=&quot;http://marilynkallet.com&quot;&gt;Marilyn Kallet&lt;/a&gt; would often mention that a certain poem was good fodder for a series. They were usually poems on subjects that were too vast for a single poem to address. I internalized that, and now have several series in progress:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;American Condition&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Catalog of Interstices&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Duende&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Letters I Didn’t Send&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;MadBear&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Note to Self&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Praise Songs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;—and have conceptualized about half a dozen others. I also have a dozen Apologias, but since I haven’t defined a framework for it, I don’t really consider it a series, per se.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;crypto&quot;&gt;Crypto&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In December, PayPal was offering no-fee transactions to promote their new support for crypto. They only support four currencies, so I bought a small amount of each:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bitcoin (BTC)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bitcoin Cash (BCH)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ethereum (ETH)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Litecoin (LTC)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the recommendation of two smarter friends who have done their research, I also opened a Coinbase account and bought into some currencies—most notably Algorand (ALGO). If you’ve been following at all, you know the whole crypto market is &lt;strong&gt;way&lt;/strong&gt; up since about November. ALGO has gone from hovering near $0.25 per unit then to flirting with $2.00 today. For a more familiar indicator, Bitcoin started November 2020 below $14,000, and hit almost $49,000 yesterday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!-- ALGO chart screenshot --&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;docimage&quot; src=&quot;images/algo_20210212.png&quot; alt=&quot;A chart showing the increasing value of the ALGO cryptocurrency over between 11 Jan &amp;amp; 12 Feb, and the price point of $0.57 on 29 Jan when I started buying.&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 500px&quot; /&gt;   &lt;figcaption style=&quot;max-width: 500px&quot;&gt;
ALGO rocket go brrrrrrrr
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I got caught as a $GME bag holder, I would have been in &amp;amp; out of Dogecoin too if Coinbase supported it. I might have to set alerts for when Elon Musk tweets so I can immediately buy whatever the fuck he’s blurbing and then sell a day later after the ensuing pump.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The market, of course, is very volatile, and the value of individual currencies can swing wildly from hour to hour, so you can’t be a reactive investor. If you want to invest some cash in crypto, here’s my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coinbase.com/join/dillon_q3b&quot;&gt;Coinbase referral link&lt;/a&gt;. If you sign up and put in $100, we both get $10 in Bitcoin.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrew P.

&lt;p&gt;Of course, that evaluation is based on the culmination of four years with Trump in office and a Republican Party of sycophants controlling the Senate. We’re likely to inch back up in next year’s evaluation, despite a number of Congresspeople who are literal conspiracy theorists. Conservatives have always been an embarrassment &amp;amp; a threat, but now absolutely everyone, including themselves, is at risk.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;cookie-consent&quot;&gt;Cookie consent&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you’ve never been to this site before, or cleared your cookies since last time, you saw the banner pop up at the bottom of the screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since I’m still learning Javascript, I kept putting the script in the wrong place, but eventually figured it out. The directions on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.osano.com/cookieconsent/download/&quot;&gt;Osano&lt;/a&gt; website were fairly clear, I just misread the step that said to put the script just before the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;/body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag—I initially read it as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; so, obviously, the script was not visible on the page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would have been more readable if it were worded: “add the following code within the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; of your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;index.html&lt;/code&gt; file, just before the closing tag.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On that Osano page, at the bottom of the &lt;em&gt;Open Source Edition&lt;/em&gt; column, click &lt;strong&gt;Start Coding&lt;/strong&gt; to expand some configuration options. In Jekyll, you would add that script into your &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;default.html&lt;/code&gt; layout file.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;content-management&quot;&gt;Content management&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to add a page called &lt;strong&gt;Read&lt;/strong&gt; to display poems that have been published, but are not immediately available because they’re either in print or the journal is no longer online. It’s obviously not up yet, and that’s because I have to decide how to deal with a single-sourcing issue with the poems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to this website, I have two other Jekyll projects:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;one for my forthcoming book, &lt;em&gt;The Great Permission&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;one to keep all my writing under version control&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideally, all my poems would live in the latter project, and whenever I needed to include one in the book or on this website, I’d pull it in from there. That way, when I revise a poem, I don’t need to do it in three places. I don’t know how to single-source across Jekyll projects, though; or even if that’s possible. I’ll have to post on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://talk.jekyll.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll Talk&lt;/a&gt; forum to get some insight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I actually also have a fourth directory of my poems in HTML that are served on my local Apache server, which I created long before I had the skill to manage a Jekyll project. I desperately wanted to get away from writing &amp;amp; editing in Word, so I put everything in HTML, wrote a stylesheet, and created a simple PHP template to make submissions easier. (I’ll detail this setup in another blog post.) I could use Jekyll to handle submissions instead, but until I solve the single-sourcing issue, there’s no point in migrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-buffalo-bills&quot;&gt;The Buffalo Bills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What a fun season! I was disappointed to see them get rolled in the AFC Championship, but they’re a young team and have the talent &amp;amp; coaching to make it back in coming years. We fans can’t have a chip on our shoulders anymore, so that’s gonna be a big attitude adjustment for most Buffalonians. If they aren’t perennial underachievers, how will we maintain this blue-collar, disrespected identity? I’m gonna have to edit my &lt;a href=&quot;/about&quot;&gt;short bio&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fulbright&quot;&gt;Fulbright&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m going to apply for one! Being a government grant, the application process is a mess. If you’ve ever applied for the NEA, it’s not &lt;em&gt;quite&lt;/em&gt; that bad, but it is a jumble of redundant pages &amp;amp; counterintuitive terminology. For example, I’ll probably apply under the “U.S. Student Program” (as opposed to the U.S. Scholar Program) despite having completed my MFA in 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also separate websites for those Fulbright programs on completely different domains:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://awards.cies.org&quot;&gt;U.S. Scholar Program&lt;/a&gt;: https://awards.cies.org&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://us.fulbrightonline.org&quot;&gt;U.S. Student Program&lt;/a&gt;: https://us.fulbrightonline.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why aren’t these programs unified at a single starting point?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, I have so many ideas for projects that I can’t decide which one to apply with. Which is a great problem to have. You can only submit a single application for a single project per cycle, so I do have to decide.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started looking into this at a good time because the current application cycle is ending. The next cycle starts in October, meaning I have plenty of time to decide on a project, write everything up, and find recommenders. (Isn’t asking other people to do work for you the absolute worst?)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Along the way, I’ll post about my progress here. Hopefully, documenting the process will make it easier for someone else down the line.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;gamestonks--amequic&quot;&gt;Gamestonks &amp;amp; AM(equi)C&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(I tried.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes I jumped on this bandwagon. I won’t explain the whole situation, but here is a &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/pkdvgy/send-this-to-anyone-who-wants-to-know-wtf-is-up-with-gamestop-stock&quot;&gt;good summary&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;img class=&quot;docimage&quot; src=&quot;images/buyStonks.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the buy amounts I paid for the popular meme stocks: AMC, BB, GME, NOK.&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 400px&quot; /&gt;   &lt;figcaption style=&quot;max-width: 400px&quot;&gt;
Holding for the meme
  &lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Quick disclaimer&lt;/strong&gt;: I’m not any kind of financial expert. You shouldn’t consider anything I say below to be advice or wisdom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m lucky to have remained employed during the pandemic, and was able to spend a modest amount to participate in this cultural moment. I don’t expect to make money on these shares; I’m in it to help squeeze Melvin Capital &amp;amp; Citron Research, and force them to pour billions into closing their positions. This will drive the stock price higher, and allow regular ole retail traders to reap some of that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This week already has been a massive redistribution of wealth from the financial elite to the middle class. This is wealth that we, as laborers whose capital is our very bodies, created. Firms like Melvin &amp;amp; Citron fuck around with the capital our labor creates, manipulate the market with ladder attacks &amp;amp; PR campaigns, and generally play with our lives &amp;amp; money as a business. Their losses this week are just the vigorish on decades of recklessness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re holding, here’s a simple site to let you know when it’s time to sell: &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://isthesqueezesquoze.com&quot;&gt;is the squeeze squoze&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Despite what r/WallStreetBets is saying, don’t hold forever. Those firms will eventually close their short positions, and then stocks like GME (which are absolutely overvalued now) will fall as everyone sells.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, I’m willing to lose everything I have invested in these stocks if it means the hedge funds lose their asses and it results in some policy change.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrew P.

&lt;p&gt;When I wasn’t doing meaningless knowledge work, here’s what I spent my time on:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;google-analytics&quot;&gt;Google Analytics&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was mostly wrong about my issue with Google Analytics. And the fix was pretty simple. As it turns out, there’s either something wrong with Minima’s GA integration, or it’s incompatible with the new GA4 tracking IDs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-minima-theme&quot;&gt;The Minima theme&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jekyll’s Minima theme comes with a file in the hidden gem directory at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_includes/google-analytics.html&lt;/code&gt;. (The gem directory is separate from the Jekyll project directory, which is kind of a pain in the ass. On Mac, it’s at &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Macintosh HD/Users/&amp;lt;username&amp;gt;/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.#.#/gems/minima-2.#.#&lt;/code&gt;. JFC.) It holds the following script:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ga&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;create&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;{{ site.google_analytics }}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;auto&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ga&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;send&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;pageview&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that same directory is &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;head.html&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;head.html&lt;/code&gt; is called by the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; layout (also in the gem directory), which means it’s part of every page. &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;head.html&lt;/code&gt; calls &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;google-analytics.html&lt;/code&gt;, which should insert the script GA needs to track your pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s also a site-wide variable for your GA tracking ID in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_config.yml&lt;/code&gt;. You can see the script above calling {{ site.google_analytics }}.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;on-the-other-hand&quot;&gt;On the other hand&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s also possible that I needed to build the site specifying &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;JEKYLL_ENV=production&lt;/code&gt; for the built-in GA code to be triggered, which is just now occurring to me as I write this. On the command line, that looks like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;language-shell highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;JEKYLL_ENV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;production jekyll build&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things are working now, so I’m not gonna fuck with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;workaround&quot;&gt;Workaround&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I found &lt;a href=&quot;https://michaelsoolee.com/google-analytics-jekyll/&quot;&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Soo Lee. Basically, it had me create a new file to hold the GA script (the one that GA tells you to use), this time in the project folder:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
  &lt;div class=&quot;language-js highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;!--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Global&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;site&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;tag&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;gtag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Google&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;Analytics&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;--&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;async&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;src&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=&amp;lt;trackingID&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;err&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;script&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dataLayer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;window&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dataLayer&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;||&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[];&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;gtag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(){&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;dataLayer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;arguments&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);}&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;gtag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;js&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Date&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;());&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;gtag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;config&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;GA tracking ID&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sr&quot;&gt;/script&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then replace the reference in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;default.html&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;google-analytics.html&lt;/code&gt; with the new file.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now my GA account is tracking data! Not sure what I’ll ever do with it on the blog, but it’ll be useful to know how everything works before I launch the book.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;cookie-consent&quot;&gt;Cookie consent&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because GA uses cookies, I decided I should provide a simple consent banner or pop-up. Not that I expect many readers in California or Europe, but it should be a fun learning project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I found an open-source project on GitHub called &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/osano/cookieconsent&quot;&gt;Osano&lt;/a&gt; that I’ll probably implement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;thebook&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-book&quot;&gt;The book&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;With this site fully operational, I started getting back to work on the manuscript. One element of the book is family recipes that really don’t exist outside of the heads of my mom &amp;amp; my aunts. For the recipes I know, it’s just rote data entry into HTML. Same for a collection of workouts. I’m using the built-in &lt;strong&gt;Collections&lt;/strong&gt; functionality to group each of them on a single page, but each individual recipe &amp;amp; workout will appear as an interlude in the primary TOC. I still have some work to do figuring out how to integrate them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;gallery&quot;&gt;Gallery&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m also planning a picture gallery similar to the above Collections, with individual images accompanying some poems &amp;amp; interludes, but I’m not sure how I’ll handle storage. I could just include all the pics in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;images&lt;/code&gt; directory, but that will increase the build &amp;amp; load times. I could host on a public Google Photos album or similar image hosting platform, but I need to look into security.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;A related issue is the recent news that Google Photos storage will count toward your total Google account storage starting in June 2021. I don’t take many pictures or videos, and don’t have a ton of media stored (relatively speaking), but will probably back up everything onto an external drive.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;h3 id=&quot;audio&quot;&gt;Audio&lt;/h3&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I have a similar issue to think through regarding recordings of me reading my poems. My dad is going to record me reading each in his studio, so the sound quality will be professional. Again though, 50–60 audio files at 45–120 seconds each will really balloon the size of the project. I’ve thought about SoundCloud, where a free account can host ~3 hours of audio. But I’m limited to certain file formats, which may make professional recordings pointless.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The plan is for each poem to have an accompanying audio file. I’m using the HTML &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;audio&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tag, which will use your browser’s default media player.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Right now, I have some scratch recordings in an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;audio&lt;/code&gt; directory; I created a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;poem&lt;/code&gt; layout, which has an include for &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;audio.html&lt;/code&gt;—a nifty piece of code I wrote to pull the correct audio file into the page with the poem:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;language-html highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;highlight highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;audio display=&quot;block&quot; controls&amp;gt;
  &amp;lt;source src=&quot;audio/{{ page.permalink | replace: 'html', 'm4a' }}&quot;&amp;gt;
  Your browser doesn't support HTML5 audio. &amp;lt;!-- fallback text for old browsers --&amp;gt;
&amp;lt;/audio&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;        &lt;/div&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It works because the poem &amp;amp; audio files use identical filenames. It’s not very complicated, but it’s probably one of the more creative pieces of code I had to figure out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;sports&quot;&gt;Sports!&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Bills play the Ravens this Saturday in the Divisional round of the playoffs. I really cannot handle the stress of a high-stakes game anymore (I haven’t had any practice in many years), so I probably won’t watch much or any of it. If they make the AFC Championship or Super Bowl, I will watch those games. In fact, I’ve already talked to my brother, and if the Bills are in SBLV on February 7, I’ll drive out to visit him so we can watch together in isolation. We’ll be isolated—not because of the pandemic or because we don’t &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to watch with friends, but—because no one will want to be in the room with us. It would be awful to vicariously experience our anxiety for 4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That said, Tennessee Vols football looks as ridiculous &amp;amp; incompetent as ever and I have no confidence in the Sabres anymore (poor Jack Eichel)—so I am fully willing to sacrifice them and all other teams I cheer for on superstition’s alter for a Bills win.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrew P.

I’m pretty proud of myself, because it’s my first website, and I figured out everything through trial &amp;amp; error and reading a LOT of help forums. &lt;!-- here --&gt;Jekyll does provide a template for the website, but I had to learn enough HTML, CSS, &amp;amp; Liquid (the templating language Jekyll uses, developed by Shopify) to write &amp;amp; modify everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, I kept getting a generic build error, so I ended up building the site locally with the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt; command, and pushing the contents of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_site&lt;/code&gt; directory (which is re-written each time you run the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;build&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;serve&lt;/code&gt; command) to my GitHub repo. I have to use a pretty manual/unsophisticated workflow to update the website for now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyway, GH Pages isn’t handling the actual source code for the blog. It doesn’t have any effect on the website except for the fact that the javascript for my Google Analytics tracker gets stripped out. I doubt anyone’s looking at the site yet, but I do ultimately want to know who/where/when visits, so I have some more troubleshooting to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-book&quot;&gt;The book&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that the website is up &amp;amp; mostly running, I’ve been finalizing poems, and even writing a few new ones. I haven’t been working on the code or design.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having gone through the process of setting up a custom domain with GH Pages, I’m a bit worried about getting the book online. Tom Johnson’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/index.html&quot;&gt;doc for his Jekyll theme&lt;/a&gt; does include instructions for publishing, but it was also last updated in 2016. I ran into a few issues with this site—the default Jekyll theme—that I’m worried will loom over that project, which is much more customized, and includes some scripting that I don’t fully understand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-buffalo-bills&quot;&gt;The Buffalo Bills&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is the first season since the 90s when I feel like they’re legitimately as good as they look (unlike the flashes of the Losman/Edwards/Fitzpatrick years). Obviously my life will change in zero ways relative to the success or failure of a professional sports team, but it means… I dunno, something… to see Buffalo’s team playing well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a boring cliche to say that a team is the lifeblood/heartbeat/soul of a town, but people in Rust Belt towns like Buffalo really care about their distractions—myself included, despite trying to ignore games &amp;amp; whole seasons over the past two decades. Like other mid-sized cities, Buffalo is undergoing something of a renaissance right now; but I grew up in the aftermath of the steel &amp;amp; grain industry exodus. Having this team to celebrate means something. I don’t know if I buy into the idea of sports-as-community, but in a crowd of Bills fans, I would without question shotgun a Labatt and body slam a folding table.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrew P.

Or anything else this year. I guess who cares since I haven’t even launched this site yet.&lt;!-- here --&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve really only started working on the book in earnest since the beginning of November. I’m shifting focus now to launch my author’s website first. I’m not sure if I’ll continue posting about the book, but for now, here’s where things stand:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div id=&quot;thebook&quot;&gt;
  &lt;h2 id=&quot;the-book&quot;&gt;The book&lt;/h2&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;When the book is done, it’ll be located at &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.thegreatpermission.com&quot;&gt;thegreatpermission.com&lt;/a&gt;. I’m creating it on top of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://idratherbewriting.com/documentation-theme-jekyll/index.html&quot;&gt;Jekyll Doc Theme&lt;/a&gt; that &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.idratherbewriting.com&quot;&gt;Tom Johnson&lt;/a&gt; built. I guess you would call it a webbook. As much as I do want a physical book to hold in my hands &amp;amp; even one day sign at my readings (!!!), the digital format allows so many opportunities for me as a writer and you as a reader:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;navigation&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;multimedia&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;interactivity&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;metapoetics/glosses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;It was too interesting to pass up. So possibly no publisher will be interested in this format (how would you monetize it?), but I think that’s okay. I have a career outside poetry, and if I have to continue balancing my professional &amp;amp; creative endeavors to travel the artistic avenues I want, I’m prepared to do that.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;!-- TGP screenshot --&gt;
  &lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img class=&quot;docimage&quot; src=&quot;images/tgpInProgress.png&quot; alt=&quot;A screenshot of the author's in-progress webbook manuscript, showing the navigation &amp;amp; menu items on a blank `About the author` page.&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 650px&quot; /&gt;     &lt;figcaption style=&quot;max-width: 650px&quot;&gt;
The book, in progress.
    &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Of course, I &lt;em&gt;want&lt;/em&gt; to quit my corporate job to write poems and give readings and talk to other artists every week. So the webbook will have links to my &lt;a href=&quot;https:www.patreon.com/andrewpdillon&quot;&gt;Patreon&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https:www.paypal.me/andrewpdillon&quot;&gt;PayPal&lt;/a&gt; =D&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The title of the book comes from a quote by poet &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.alicefrimanpoet.com&quot;&gt;Alice Friman&lt;/a&gt;. I’m not sure if it’s codified in a book or interview anywhere, but she visited the University of Tennessee when I was in the first semester of my MFA. &lt;q&gt;Poetry is the great permission&lt;/q&gt; is one of the many very quotable things she said during her craft talk.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The structure of the book is mostly in place. There are several poems I want to finish or revise before I publish the website, and that’s probably the bulk of the remaining work. But I still have a bunch of items to check off before the site is done from a technical perspective; the biggest ones are:&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;ul&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;figure out the logic for previous &amp;amp; next buttons&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;build a dark theme&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;li&gt;set up Google Analytics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;previous/next&lt;/strong&gt; buttons are complicated because I’m not in any sense a web developer. I have that functionality here on the blog because it’s a built-in variable for posts. The doc theme that I’m using for the book uses a YAML file to define the TOC, and I want the previous/next logic to loop through that to spit out buttons. It’s definitely possible because there’s separate logic that loops through that same YAML to create the sidebar navigation, and Jekyll’s own doc does something similar with its tutorials. I just don’t know what the fuck I’m doing yet.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m also color deficient (similar to colorblind), and color palettes mean nothing to me, so the dark theme will be weird.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I’m using &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.asana.com&quot;&gt;Asana&lt;/a&gt; to manage the effort, which I like a LOT more than other project management tools I’ve used. I’ve been part of Corporate America for almost a decade now, so I’ve used most of the big ones.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;I hate Git, but use it because it’s integral to Jekyll &amp;amp; GitHub Pages.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-than-poetry&quot;&gt;Other than poetry&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I work in the healthcare industry as a Technical Writer. I’m in Nashville, where healthcare is maybe the biggest industry in the city—yes, even larger than music or tourism. It’s a wonderful career for an introvert. I wouldn’t have the skillset to put together this blog, much less my book, without my career in TechCom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been studying Spanish since June 2018. I use Duolingo every day (with a 906 day streak as of Dec 16), and before the pandemic, I took group classes at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://tfli.org&quot;&gt;Tennessee Language Center&lt;/a&gt;. I’m not fluent by any stretch, but if I spent a couple months in a Spanish-speaking community, I think I’d come out communicating effectively.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m from Buffalo. The Bills are having a great season, and I’m not saying I had anything to do with that, but as soon as I stopped believing in jinxes, the Pegulas hired Sean McDermott &amp;amp; Brandon Beane. ::shrug:: Even though my family has been in Nashville since I was nine, I still consider myself “from” Buffalo. I’ve encountered a lot of people who have different opinions about how I should identify in that regard. Which is fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lots of people also misspell my last name. It’s &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;D-I-L-L-O-N&lt;/code&gt;. No second “i”. As far as I know, “Dillion” has never been a surname anywhere in the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Okay! That seems like a whole blog post.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrew P.

Once I get the &lt;a href=&quot;&quot;&gt;site&lt;/a&gt; built, I might continue blogging about drafting new poems, reading/performing, publishing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Partly, I think this blog will help keep me accountable. Mostly, I think it’ll be useful to articulate the issues I have using the tools &amp;amp; logic I’m trying to learn. For example, “site” in the previous paragraph should have been a link to the homepage of this site. But it didn’t work. ::shrug::&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The goal for this site is to serve as my author website, but I also have a second Jekyll instance that I’m using to write the manuscript for my first poetry collection. I’ll probably write here about my vision for that book, and my plans for compiling it using this toolset.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Andrew P.
