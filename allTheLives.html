<meta name="description" content="I have more scraps now than poems— more hopes &amp; fears abandoned than dreams realized. What dreams, if any, have I realized? How many dreams have I ever conceived? Ages 6–22 I wanted to play soccer and did, but no one paid me so I took up poetry. I’ve never known what I wanted so maybe I’m still a boy which is how most millennials feel— about me, personally, &amp; other men my age. Basquiat started a revolution to warn us about the dangers of the same old shit, but I keep investing in the future like Republicans won&#39;t privatize climate restoration to profit off land deserted. Desert-ed. I continue to feel small &amp; useless probably because I keep reading the news &amp; election results. The west-facing walls of my house have no windows so by 1pm every day I’m ready to hold the night like a lover who keeps her underwear on in bed. A surplus of local coffee shops exacerbates my anxiety. I drink seltzer with lime. I’m hydrated as fuck. I worry the lives I abandoned are thriving in another universe, and ashamed of me. I don’t reach through the folds of timespace for them because I know some branches of my life are rotten, and I won’t risk slipping into nothing." />
