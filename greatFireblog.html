<p>This post was originally part of an earlier post, but I realized I had a lot to unpack about submissions. <!-- here --></p>

<p>Since October, I’ve been submitting to journals regularly again. My favorite way to approach submissions is to submit to one journal every day for a week or so. If I can do that once a month (pretty reasonable), I’ve submitted roughly 420 poems to 84 journals in one year. My acceptance rate is around 3% since I began submitting in 2007, meaning if I actually follow through, I should theoretically have a dozen poems taken during that year.</p>

<p>I prefer this method to batch submitting, which feels like a lot of work (because it is), which means I usually put it off until next Sunday.</p>

<p>Why does Sunday feel like <strong>the</strong> day for submissions?</p>

<h2 id="my-setup">My setup</h2>
<p>I detailed my current submission architecture &amp; plans for improving it in <a href="/dreamCommonSub">my submissions post</a>.</p>

<h2 id="cover-letters">Cover letters</h2>
<p>Why do these still exist? Almost every editor I’ve spoken to or read an interview with is clear that they don’t read them.</p>

<p>If I happen to know the editor of a journal, I’ll include a personal note, but I’m not gonna force some insincere “what I like about your publication” paragraph. I always read recent samples (if available) and try to match my submission to those samples &amp; the stated aesthetic. Like most of us, I spend a significant chunk of time deciding what to send and then formatting that document.</p>

<p>We all suspect you spend 30 seconds rejecting 96% of your submissions, so why would we spend additional time crafting some disingenuous line that echoes the <strong>About</strong> page like we’re trying to get a job interview?</p>

<h2 id="simultaneous-submissions">Simultaneous submissions</h2>
<p>Did you know there are still journals that don’t accept simultaneous submissions?</p>

<p>For anyone who doesn’t write, simultaneous subs are pieces (poems, stories, essays) that you submit to multiple publication venues at the same times. For a journal, I can theoretically understand why you wouldn’t want to accept them—if you invest time &amp; resources into reading a piece and start planning an issue based on the submissions you’ve received, and then have an author pull it because it was accepted elsewhere (maybe they confirmed the acceptance, but got an acceptance at a journal they wanted to be in more), that throws a big wrench in your planning, and compromises the release of your issue.</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
<strong>Quick Aside</strong>   <p>Why, in an environment that enables immediate updates, do the vast majority of journals still group poems into issues &amp; wait months to put out a collection of writing from disparate authors?</p>
  <p>A few journals, like the defunct <cite class="journal">Public Pool</cite>, have adopted a new model, but I'm surprised that the concept of "volumes" &amp; "issues" remains prevalent.</p>
</div>

<p>In practice, though, the big problem is that most journals take <strong>a really long time</strong> to respond. For prose writers, I think it’s unacceptable to not accept simultaneous subs. Speaking as a poet, I spend months, sometimes years, on a poem; but I have dozens of poems ready to be published, and it generally takes much less time to complete a draft of a poem compared to a short story or essay. If you have a great short story, are you willing to let it be tied up for a full year while it’s under consideration at one of the more prestigious journals? They’re the worst offenders, simply because the volume of submissions they receive is massive.</p>

<p>I’m not, and I have about three dozen unpublished poems that I feel are ready for publication. []</p>

<h2 id="fees">Fees</h2>
<p>I don’t pay them. Which makes submitting increasingly difficult. I’ve paid for a handful of slush pile submissions or contests in the past, but I’m done with that. I generally don’t have any ethical concerns with fees for contests (even though sometimes a winner isn’t chosen after the journal collected everyone’s fee), but I don’t submit to contests either. If I wanna get rid of $20–30, I’ll make an extra donation to my local NPR station.</p>

<p>I really do understand why editors have to charge them when using Submittable or a similar platform, but I’m also uncomfortable with the ethics of charging your potential contributors for a chance at publication. And how fees shrink the pool of writers who have the ability to submit. And the idea that I’m spending money so some unpaid reader will spend 20 seconds reading a poem that took me five years to complete. It <em>does not</em> matter that it’s a “service fee” and not a “reading fee”; those are the semantics that allow you to justify the cost.</p>

<p>Art doesn’t need to generate a profit to justify its existence; believing that, I hesitate to use language that commodifies art. However, the journal is the business of the editors (I know most don’t get paid). Like any other business, it’s their responsibility to offset their overhead. Submittable is a great product because it simplifies the work of managing the journal, but you don’t have to use it. You can run a journal without that cost.</p>

<p>I don’t know what kind of model would generate revenue for a literary journal; I don’t run one so I don’t have to think too hard about it. And I understand that the real issue is that people aren’t willing to pay for poetry, short stories, &amp; essays.</p>

<div class="bs-callout bs-callout-info">
<strong>some title</strong>   <p>I'm always a little amused at how irritated musicians have become with the economics of art in the digital age. Writers have always understood that society does not ascribe any monetary value to our work, so we developed with the knowledge that our art would not professionally sustain us.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="so-what-wanna-fight-about-it">So what wanna fight about it?</h3>
<p>Given that reality, I do not know where the money comes from, if not for grants &amp; institutional support. (BTW, if you’re a journal with university support, and you still charge a submission fee, get right the fuck outta my face.) Another difficult reality to consider is that most literary journals just aren’t very good. Like, the poems &amp; stories in them aren’t very interesting, or even well crafted.</p>

<p>Speaking as a poet, I think we celebrate a lot of mediocre poetry. And it’s our fault that bad poetry gets platformed. I think because we all see the economic impossibility of being professional poets, we tend toward unfailing support of other artists. I think that’s detrimental to the poems. I’m not saying we should cut down other artists. I am saying we need more genuine criticism. We need to find ways to offer that criticism—when the artist asks for it. Journal editors don’t have time for that, of course, and probably aren’t getting paid anyway. But in our communities, we’ve got to find a way to both ask for &amp; offer honest feedback to each other.</p>

<p>It’s complicated, I know. Editing is difficult work, and deserves to be compensated. But I think we can build these relationships in our writing circles. A simple tit-for-tat exchange. If you’re like me, you don’t want to ask for someone’s time &amp; energy; if we can get past the awkwardness of requesting feedback &amp; being honest, I think it ultimately benefits everyone.</p>

<h3 id="an-old-model">An old model</h3>
<p>I enjoy the Great British Bake Off. One big reason is that I think Paul Hollywood is an excellent gatekeeper. He freely praises bakers when they excel. And when he criticizes them, he’s <em>always</em> constructive. He never insults the person. He might say their bread is atrocious, inedible, but he <em>always</em> tells them what they did wrong and how to improve.</p>

<p>In Dana Gioia’s’ famous article <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/unbound/poetry/gioia/gioia.htm">“Can Poetry Matter?”</a> (<em>The Atlantic</em>, May 1991), he offers some advice for making poetry better &amp; more culturally relevant. It’s been 30 years, and I’m not sure we’ve made much progress in promoting poetry above a subculture. I appreciate this article for its directness in naming the issues that limit the poetry community; namely, that we mostly have a intensely cloistered <em>poetry</em> community and not a broader artistic community. He also discusses the disingenuousness of criticism. We rarely write or offer critical feedback, and in any case, most of our feedback is published in specialist publications dedicated to poetry (&amp; maybe short fiction), written using academic jargon.</p>

<p>(To call back to <a href="/howOurStudentsLearned">an earlier post</a>, Gioia also encourages teachers to spend less time analyzing poetry, and more time performing it, emphasizing “the sheer joy of the art”.)</p>

<p>In that vein, I subscribe to a Hollywood-Gioia class of poetic criticism. Gioia said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>[P]oets must regain the reader’s trust by candidly admitting<br />
what they don’t like as well as promoting what they like.<br />
Professional courtesy has no place in literary journalism.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we could combine that with responses that also suggest how the piece can be improved, [].</p>

<p>You might think that sounds like the workshop model that’s common in higher education. And maybe you were lucky enough to be part of cohorts who were willing to take the time to read, reread, &amp; offer detailed feedback. I sometimes was, but sporadically. I think a lot of us may not have been in the practice of criticizing genuinely. []</p>
